This plugin, for the open source seismic interpretation platform [opendtect] Version 6.4.0 or later, exports [opendtect] data to a
[GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/) database. GeoPackage is an open, non-proprietary, platform-independent, self describing
standards-based data format for geospatial data.

## Description

The plugin adds a "Geopackage Export" item to the Survey-Export main menu. Selecting the item opens a tabbed dialog box for selecting
the various elements to export and the destination file name. The following table shows the [opendtect] data elements supported and
the corresponding tables created in the exported GeoPackage database.

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| OpendTect Item | GeoPackage Table Name | Geometry | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------------|----------|-------|
| Survey Box | Survey | Polygon | Single attribute, the survey name |
| 2D Line Geometry | 2DLines | LineString | Single attribute, the line name |
| 2D Line Stations | 2DStations | Points | Two attributes, the line name and station number |
| Random Lines | RandomLines | LineString | Single attribute, the random line name |
| Wells | Wells | Points | Well surface location and 3 attributes, the well name, UWID and status (not currently set by OpendTect) |
| Well Tracks | WellTracks | LineString | Single attribute, the well name |
| Well Markers', 'WellMarkers', 'Points | Four attributes, well name, marker name, MD and TVDSS |
| Open Polygons | PolyLines | LineString | Single attribute, the polyline name. The z values of the polyline are not exported |
| Closed Polygons | Polygons | Polygon | Single attribute, the polygon name. The z values of the polygon are not exported |
| 2D and 3D Horizons | Set by the user | Point | Single attribute, the horizon z value in millisecs or metres depending on the Z domain of the survey |
{{</table>}}

### Notes
-  It is possible to append to an existing database. This is primarily used for exporting multiple horizons/attributes to the same GeoPackage.
-  Appending does not overwrite items already in the GeoPackage it will just add another copy to the respective table.
-  The plugin requires the survey to have a projection based CRS defined.
-  **On Windows the folder containing the plugin DLL's must be added to the PATH environment variable either by editing the corresponding system variable (Control Panel>System and Security>System - Advanced system settings - Environment Variables) or adding a line like "@set PATH=%HOMEPATH%\.od\bin\win64\Release;%PATH%" (adjust "%HOMEPATH%\.od\bin\win64\Release" to reflect your installation) to the bat script used to start OpendTect.**
-  The GeoPackage format is supported by major GIS software packages. The following figure shows display of data exported from OpendTect using the plugin in the open source GIS package, [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/).

## Input Parameters

The dialog box associated with the plugin has a file entry control to select the output file, a check box to allow appending to the output file instead of overwriting and 8 tabs to select the content to export:
