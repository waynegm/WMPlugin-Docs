# Building from Source

## Linux
These instructions are for Linux.

1. Download the source for the plugins for the appropriate version of OpendTect from Github

    - [Latest OpendTect v6.6](https://github.com/waynegm/OpendTect-Plugins/archive/master.zip)
    - [OpendTect v6.4](https://github.com/waynegm/OpendTect-Plugins/archive/6.4.zip)
    - [OpendTect v5](https://github.com/waynegm/OpendTect-Plugins/archive/v5-stable.zip)
    - [OpendTect v4](https://github.com/waynegm/OpendTect-4-plugins/archive/master.zip)

2. Use the OpendTect installation manager to install the OpendTect developer packages and install any other packages required for compiling and building code for your operating environment as per the <a href="http://www.opendtect.org/rel/doc/Programmer/" target="_blank">OpendTect Programmer's Manual</a>

3. Start OpendTect

4. Select the *Utilities-Tools-Create Plugin Devel. Env.* menu item to create a development work folder (eg /home/user/ODWork).

5. Unzip the attribute source zip archive downloaded in step 1 in the development work folder. This will overwrite the *CMakeLists.txt* in the development work folder and add the plugin source folders to the plugin folder.

6. Optionally edit *CMakeCache.txt* in the development work folder and change Debug to Release.

7. Open a terminal, cd to the development work folder and type:
```
	cmake .
	make
```

9. This should create the binary files for each plugin, lib\*.so and libui\*.so, in the bin folder (eg in ODWork/bin/lux64/Release/) and four \*.alo files for each plugin in the root of the development work folder.

## Windows
These instructions are for Windows.

3. Start OpendTect

4. Select the *Utilities-Tools-Create Plugin Devel. Env.* menu item to create a development work folder (eg c:\Users\user\ODWork).

5. Unzip the attribute source zip archive downloaded in step 1 in the development work folder. This will overwrite the *CMakeLists.txt* in the development work folder and add the plugin source folders to the plugin folder.

6. Follow the instructions in the [OpendTect Programmer's Manual](http://opendtect.org/rel/doc/Programmer/windows.html) to configure and build the plugins.

7. This should create the binary files for each plugin in the bin folder (eg in ODWork\bin\win64\Release).

On Windows you must use "Release" build plugins with the "Release" version of OpendTect.
